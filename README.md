Modeling Business Cost of Retention
This analysis consists of a full EDA and predictive analysis of attrition at this firm, followed by some calculations of the likely business costs under each of the various models I will use. The key insight I am pursuing here is the tradeoff between model accuracy and ROI - a more accurate model of attrition does not necessarily lead to a higher return on investment of a firm's retention budget. Understanding this and being able to talk intelligently about it is key to creating workable retention strategies that make the HR function truly strategic.\n\nAs background, there has been a great deal of talk for a couple decades now about the need for HR to be more strategic. Aside from any philosophical discussions of the true nature of 'strategy' and strategic thinking, what this normally means is that business leaders want HR to be more like their marketing departments - analytical, results-oriented, and able to directly tie their activities to the firm's desired outcomes. Marketing firms today rely quite heavily on predictive analytics and data mining/data science. The future of HR likely lies along this same road.
